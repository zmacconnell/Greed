# Greed
One of the 7 deadly sins, Greed can get you in trouble. This game is all about
balance between getting gems (*) and avoiding rocks (O). If you get a gem you
earn 1 point, but get hit by a rock and you lose 3. How many point can you 
gather?

```
You can also run the program from an IDE like Visual Studio Code. 
Start your IDE and open the project folder. Select "Run and Debug" on 
the Activity Bar. Next, select the project you'd like to run from the 
drop down list at the top of the Side Bar. Lastly, click the green 
arrow or "start debugging" button.
